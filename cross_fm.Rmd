First level

$$
Place\_at\_ Finish_{ijh} = 
\beta_{0jh} + \beta_{cjh}*Cluster\_Membership_{ijh} + \beta_{njh}*Controls_{ijh} + \epsilon_{ijh}
$$

Second level

$$
\beta_{0jh} = \gamma_{000} + u_{0j0} + s_{00h} \\
\beta_{cjh} = \gamma_{c00} + u_{cj0}, \ for\ c âˆˆ \ {1,2,3}

$$

where an observation $i$ is nested within a jockey $j$ and horse $h$, s is a number of cluster memberships minus one (the reference group), n is a number of control variables;

all betas are regression parameter estimates with gammas being their jockey- and horse-level intercepts;

$u_{0j0}$, $s_{00h}$ are random intercepts by jockeys and horses respectively;

$u_{cj0}$ is a random slope by jockeys for the effect of trajectory clusters on the final place in a race.

$\epsilon$ is a normally distributed error term.
